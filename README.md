# Tilde

~~Inspired by~~ [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)â€”~~the idea is to have a homepage for your browser that is functional and sexy.~~

*Sort of*  forked from [Tilde by cadejscroggins] (https://github.com/cadejscroggins/tilde/ 

At the moment, a complete copy/paste job,starting from the true Tilde base so progress can be documented as it mutates into something unique-ish

## Usage

To go to a site, enter the corresponding key. To view the available sites and their keys, press `?`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic Google search will be triggered. For example:

- Entering `r` would redirect you to [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com).
- Entering `t` would redirect you to [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv).
- Entering `cats` would search [Google for cats](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cats).

On mobile, you can click the clock to focus the search input.

### Searching

You can search any of the sites by typing a colon after the site's key, followed by your search query. For example:

- Entering `g:tilde` would search [GitHub for tilde](https://github.com/search?q=tilde).
- Entering `s:radiohead` would search [SoundCloud for radiohead](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=radiohead).

### Specific Locations

You can go to a specific location on a site by typing a forward slash after the site's key, followed by the location on the site you'd like to be redirected to. For example:

- Entering `r/r/startpages` would redirect you to [www.reddit.com/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)
- Entering `h/popular` would redirect you to [hypem.com/popular](http://hypem.com/popular).

### URL Redirects

If you enter in a full domain or URL, you will be redirected to said domain or URL. For example:

- Entering `stallman.org` would redirect you to [stallman.org](https://stallman.org/).
- Entering `https://smile.amazon.com` would redirect you to [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/).

### Query Paramater

Additionally, you can pass any query via the `q` query param. For example:

- Going to `file:///path/to/tilde/index.html?q=cats` would search [Google for cats](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cats).

This allows you to invoke Tilde with your native browser search bar.
